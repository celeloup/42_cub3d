A LIST OF TESTS TO PERFORM ON CUB3D

== REGULAR TESTS BECAUSE OF 42 REQUIREMENTS ==

norminette on srcs
make
make clean
make fclean
make re
Makefile doesn't relink everything when one file is changed
libft if used is in a folder with its own Makefile, called in the main Makefile
same for the minilibx if sources are provided in the project


== FOLLOWING TESTS SHOULD NOT WORK AND RETURN AN ERROR MESSAGE ==
== YOU SHOULD ALSO CHECK THAT THE PROGRAM DOES NOT LEAK ==

-- GESTION ARGUMENTS -- 
No argument
./Cub3D

Too many arguments
./Cub3D this is too many arguments

Bad arguments
./Cub3D badargument

Good then bad argument
./Cub3D maps/map.cub badargument

Bad then good argument
./Cub3D bad --save


-- .CUB FILE PARSING --
(those tests should NOT open a window in my opinion 
as the parsing of the entry file should be done 
before initialising the mlx window to avoid allocating
unecessary ressources)
(also you may find some tests to be unecessary 
or maybe you just decided to parse it differently than me
i'm just sharing the tests that I made for MY parsing
those are not officials tests)

Bad extension of file
./Cub3D maps/bad_maps/bad_extension

Empty map file
./Cub3D maps/bad_maps/empty_map.cub

Space before argument letter
./Cub3D maps/bad_maps/spaces_before_letter.cub

** RESOLUTION ARGUMENT **
Missing resolution argument
./Cub3D maps/bad_maps/resolution_missing.cub

Too many argument in resolution
./Cub3D maps/bad_maps/resolution_too_many_argument.cub

Missing argument in resolution
./Cub3D maps/bad_maps/resolution_missing_argument.cub

Bad argument in resolution
./Cub3D maps/bad_maps/resolution_bad_argument.cub
./Cub3D maps/bad_maps/resolution_bad_argument_bis.cub

Negative resolution
./Cub3D maps/bad_maps/resolution_negative.cub

Null or too small resolution 
(I consider that if the resolution is too small to actually vizualize 
anything, it should be considered a bad resolution 
but it is not specified in the subject 
so you can actually do whatever you want)
./Cub3D maps/bad_maps/resolution_null.cub
./Cub3D maps/bad_maps/resolution_too_small.cub


** TEXTURES **









== TESTS THAT SHOULD WORK (with conditions)==

Multi-spaced arguments (spaces between elements)
./Cub3D maps/multi_spaced_argument.cub

Resolution bigger than screen-size (the window size should be of the screen size)
./Cub3D maps/bigger_screen_resolution.cub
